Solar power generation lately is certainly a new alternative to replace fossil-powered electricity generation. Of course in Indonesia, a tropical climate has the advantage of utilizing solar radiation into a source of electricity. By utilizing solar panels to supply VRLA batteries as power supply to lamps controlled by Arduino Uno microcontrollers and cell phone Charging Stations that will charge VRLA batteries during the day and can be enjoyed at night.
